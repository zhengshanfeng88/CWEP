# Introduce

Based-on the family trio design (RNA-seq of parents-child), within each cross combination, there are three types of DEG obtained from P-vs-M, P-vs-H and M-vs-H comparisons respectively.
A union of DEG of P-vs-M, P-vs-H and M-vs-H in a cross combination, can be used to perform cross-wise gene expression patterns (CWEPs) analysis.

P denote paternal parent.
M denote maternal parent.
H denote hybrid.

## five super-classes
above high-parent (AHP), high-parent (HP), middle-parent (MP), low-parent (LP) and below low-parent (BLP) expression levels in hybrid as compared to their parents
